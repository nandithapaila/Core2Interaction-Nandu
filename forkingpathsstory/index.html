    . . . and I hung up the phone. Immediately I recollected the voice that had spoken in 
German. It was that of Captain Richard Madden. Madden, in Viktor Runeberg's 
office, meant the end of all our work and - though this seemed a secondary matter, 
or should have seemed so to me - of our lives also. His being there meant that 
Runeberg had been arrested or murdered. 1 Before the sun set on this same day, I ran 
the same risk. Madden was implacable. Rather, to be more accurate, he was obliged 
to be implacable. An Irishman in the service of England, a man suspected of equivocal 
feelings if not of actual treachery, how could he fail to welcome and seize upon this 
extraordinary piece of luck: the discovery, capture and perhaps the deaths of two 
agents of Imperial Germany?

    I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station further on. The 
train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I hurried, for the next would not go 
until half past nine. There was almost no one on the platform. I walked through the 
carriages. I remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in 
Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier. 

At last the train pulled out. A man I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of 
the platform. It was Captain Richard Madden. Shattered, trembling, I huddled in the 
distant corner of the seat, as far as possible from the fearful window. 

From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. I told myself that 
the duel had already started and that I had won the first encounter by besting my 
adversary in his first attack - even if it was only for forty minutes - by an accident of 
fate. I argued that so small a victory prefigured a total victory.

    For a moment I thought that Richard Madden might in some way have divined my 
desperate intent. At once I realized that this would be impossible. The advice about 
turning always to the left reminded me that such was the common formula for 
finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths. I know something about 
labyrinths. Not for nothing am I the greatgrandson of Ts'ui Pen. He was Governor of 
Yunnan and gave up temporal power to write a novel with more characters than 
there are in the Hung Lou Meng, and to create a maze in which all men would lose 
themselves. He spent thirteen years on these oddly assorted tasks before he was 
assassinated by a stranger. His novel had no sense to it and nobody ever found his 
labyrinth. 

Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical labyrinth. I 
imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain; I 
imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea; I imagined it infinite, 
made not only of eight-sided pavilions and of twisting paths but also of rivers, 
provinces and kingdoms ... I thought of a maze of mazes, of a sinuous, ever growing 
maze which would take in both past and future and would somehow involve the 
stars.

Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an 
avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion. 
Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: 
the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had 
accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there 
was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The 
stuttering sparks of the music kept on. 

But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; a 
lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by 
the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the 
moon. A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me. 

He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language. 

"I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. 
No doubt you want to see the garden?" 

Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback. 

"The garden?" 

"The garden of forking paths." 

Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance: 

"The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen." 

"Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? Come in." 

The damp path zigzagged like those of my childhood. When we reached the house, 
we went into a library filled with books from both East and West. I recognized some 
large volumes bound in yellow silk-manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia which was 
edited by the Third Emperor of the Luminous Dynasty. They had never been 
printed. A phonograph record was spinning near a bronze phoenix. I remember also 
a rose-glazed jar and yet another, older by many centuries, of that blue color which 
our potters copied from the Persians . . . 

Stephen Albert was watching me with a smile on his face. He was, as I have said, 
remarkably tall. His face was deeply lined and he had gray eyes and a gray beard. 
There was about him something of the priest, and something of the sailor.

"Those of the blood of Ts'ui Pen," I replied, "still curse the memory of that monk. 
Such a publication was madness. The book is a shapeless mass of contradictory 
rough drafts. I examined it once upon a time: the hero dies in the third chapter, 
while in the fourth he is alive. As for that other enterprise of Ts'ui Pen ... his 
Labyrinth . . ." 

"Here is the Labyrinth," Albert said, pointing to a tall, laquered writing cabinet. 

"An ivory labyrinth?" I exclaimed. "A tiny labyrinth indeed . . . !" 

"A symbolic labyrinth," he corrected me. "An invisible labyrinth of time. I, a 
barbarous Englishman, have been given the key to this transparent mystery. After 
more than a hundred years most of the details are irrecoverable, lost beyond all 
recall, but it isn't hard to image what must have happened. At one time, Ts'ui Pen 
must have said; 'I am going into seclusion to write a book,' and at another, 'I am 
retiring to construct a maze.' Everyone assumed these were separate activities. No 
one realized that the book and the labyrinth were one and the same. The Pavilion of 
the Limpid Sun was set in the middle of an intricate garden. This may have suggested 
the idea of a physical maze.

    "Naturally, my attention was caught by the sentence, 'I leave to various future times, 
but not to all, my garden of forking paths: I had no sooner read this, than I 
understood. The Garden of Forking Paths was the chaotic novel itself. The phrase 'to 
various future times, but not to all' suggested the image of bifurcating in time, not in 
space. Rereading the whole work confirmed this theory. In all fiction, when a man is 
faced with alternatives he chooses one at the expense of the others. In the almost 
unfathomable Ts'ui Pen, he chooses - simultaneously - all of them. He thus creates 
various futures, various times which start others that will in their turn branch out 
and bifurcate in other times. This is the cause of the contradictions in the novel. 

"Fang, let us say, has a secret. A stranger knocks at his door. Fang makes up his mind 
to kill him. Naturally there are various possible outcomes. Fang can kill the intruder, 
the intruder can kill Fang, both can be saved, both can die and so on and so on. In 
Ts'ui Pen's work, all the possible solutions occur, each one being the point of 
departure for other bifurcations. Sometimes the pathways of this labyrinth converge. 
For example, you come to this house; but in other possible pasts you are my enemy; 
in others my friend.

        "Precisely," said Albert. "The Garden of Forking Paths is an enormous guessing game, 
or parable, in which the subject is time. The rules of the game forbid the use of the 
word itself. To eliminate a word completely, to refer to it by means of inept phrases 
and obvious paraphrases, is perhaps the best way of drawing attention to it. This, 
then, is the tortuous method of approach preferred by the oblique Ts'ui Pen in every 
meandering of his interminable novel. I have gone over hundreds of manuscripts, I 
have corrected errors introduced by careless copyists, I have worked out the plan 
from this chaos, I have restored, or believe I have restored, the original. I have 
translated the whole work. I can state categorically that not once has the word time 
been used in the whole book. 

"The explanation is obvious. The Garden of Forking Paths is a picture, incomplete 
yet not false, of the universe such as Ts'ui Pen conceived it to be. Differing from 
Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and 
uniform. He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading 
network of diverging, converging and parallel times. This web of time - the strands of 
which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the 
centuries - embraces every possibility. We do not exist in most of them. In some 
you exist and not I, while in others I do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us 
exist. In this one, in which chance has favored me, you have come to my gate. In 
another, you, crossing the garden, have found me dead. In yet another, I say these 
very same words, but am an error, a phantom."

    Albert rose from his seat. He stood up tall as he opened the top drawer of the high 
writing cabinet. For a moment his back was again turned to me. I had the revolver 
ready. I fired with the utmost care: Albert fell without a murmur, at once. I swear 
that his death was instantaneous, as if he had been struck by lightning. 

What remains is unreal and unimportant. Madden broke in and arrested me. I have 
been condemned to hang. Abominably, I have yet triumphed! The secret name of the 
city to be attacked got through to Berlin. Yesterday it was bombed. I read the news 
in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the murder 
of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. The Chief, 
however, had already solved this mystery. He knew that my problem was to shout, 
with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, the name of the city called Albert, 
and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. He 
does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.
